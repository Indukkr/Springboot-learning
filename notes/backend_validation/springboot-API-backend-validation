# Section 10: Validation in Spring Boot API | Backend Validation

## Introduction to Validation in Spring Boot

Validation in Spring Boot ensures that the data received by an application meets certain rules before it is processed.

Example:
- Password should be alphanumeric
- Email should follow valid format
- Required fields must not be null

Spring Boot uses **Hibernate Validator** (implementation of Jakarta Bean Validation) for performing validations.

## Common Validation Annotations in Spring Boot

- `@NotNull` → Field must not be null
- `@NotEmpty` → Field must not be null and must contain at least one character
- `@Size(min = X, max = Y)` → Specifies size limits for String/Collection
- `@Email` → Validates email format
- `@Min(value)` → Minimum numeric value allowed
- `@Max(value)` → Maximum numeric value allowed

## Example

```java
import jakarta.validation.constraints.*;

public class CategoryDTO {

    @NotEmpty(message = "Category name cannot be empty")
    private String categoryName;

    @Size(min = 3, max = 20, message = "Length must be between 3 and 20")
    private String description;

    @Min(value = 1, message = "Minimum value is 1")
    @Max(value = 100, message = "Maximum value is 100")
    private int priority;
}
